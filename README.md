# AbledMicrosoftImagineCup

In this project, an accessibility application will be created. The main objective is to create a website that aims to categorize places that are accessible for people with partial or complete disabilities.

In addition to the main function, the project will have some other functions that implemented the system.

For now, the project will only support mobile devices, but desktop responsiveness will be implemented in the future.

At first we will use JS, HTML, CSS & PHP, but this may change in the future.
